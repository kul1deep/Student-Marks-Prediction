**🎯 Student Marks Prediction**


**📘 Overview**
The Student Marks Prediction project aims to predict students’ marks based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, and past academic performance. Using Machine Learning, the model helps teachers and students understand how different factors affect academic success and provides insights to improve learning outcomes.


**🧠 Key Features**
- Predicts student marks with high accuracy (✅ 89% accuracy)
- Uses Linear Regression for prediction.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for better model performance.
- Visualizes the relationship between input factors and final marks.
- Helps identify students who may need additional academic support


**🛠️ Technologies Used**
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


**⚙️ How It Works**
- Load and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, normalize data).
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train the Linear Regression model.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.
- Predict student marks based on input features.


**📊 Result**
The model achieved 89% prediction accuracy, demonstrating effective performance in predicting students’ marks based on the given inputs.


**🚀 Future Enhancements**
- Add more parameters such as class participation, assignments, and test scores.
- Implement other machine learning models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
- Build a simple web interface using Streamlit for real-time prediction.
